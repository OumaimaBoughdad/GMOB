# Dungeon Generation Project

This project is a Unity-based game where I implemented procedural dungeon generation. The game includes features such as enemies, coins generation, and pathfinding using the A* algorithm.

## Features
- **Procedural Dungeon Generation**: The dungeon layout is generated procedurally, providing a unique experience each time the game is played.
- **Enemies and Coins Generation**: Enemies and coins are placed in the dungeon procedurally.
- **Pathfinding**: Implemented A* algorithm for enemy pathfinding to navigate through the dungeon.

## Technologies Used
- **Unity**: Used for the game development environment.
- **C#**: The programming language used for scripting within Unity.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OumaimaBoughdad/GMOB.git
